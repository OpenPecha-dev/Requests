## Housekeeping

*Please add ref in specified format into `RFC` title, e.g `[RFC9999]` if the corresponding RFW is `[RFW9999]`.*

*Please add into this `RFC` and related `PR's` titles `[RFC_id]` e.g `[RFC_9999]`.*

ALL BELOW FIELDS ARE REQUIRED

## Named Concepts

*Explain any new concepts introduced in this request.*

## Summary

*Explain in a Single paragraph what this request is about.*

## Reference-Level Explanation

*This section provides a detailed technical overview of the work. The design is explained with enough depth and detail to make it clear how:*

<em>

> The proposed changes interact with other systems (or other parts of the system that is changed)


> The actual implementation will take place


> Known challenges can be readily overcome



</em>

*This section includes practical examples and explains how this proposal makes those examples work.*

*This section becomes the engineering specification and work plan, so it must be sufficiently detailed to facilitate that.*

## Alternatives

*Confirm that alternative approaches have been evaluated and explain those alternatives briefly.*


### Rationale

> Why the currently proposed design was selected over alternatives?


> What would be the impact of going with one of the alternative approaches?


> Is the evaluation tentative, or is it recommended to use more time to evaluate different approaches?



## Drawbacks

*Describe any particular caveats and drawbacks that may arise from fulfilling this particular request?*

## Useful References

*Describe useful parallels and learnings from other requests, or work in previous projects.*


> What similar work have we already successfully completed?


> Is this something that has already been built by others?


> What other related learnings do we have?


> Are there useful academic literature or other articles related to this topic? (provide links)


> Have we built a relevant prototype previously?


> Do we have a rough mock for the UI/UX?


> Do we have a schematic for the system?



## Unresolved Questions

1. What is there that is unresolved (and will be resolved as part of fulfilling this request)?
dsd

> Are there other requests with same or similar problems to solve?
